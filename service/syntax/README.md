# Syntaxhighlight.in

Syntaxhighlight.in is an online tool to display formatted source code.
See [syntaxhighlight.in](http://syntaxhighlight.in)

## Background

We want to display formatted source code in our web pages without having to load more JS/CSS than whe need to.
And to avoid a flash of un-styled content (aka FOUC), we prefer not to do that dynamically.

## Install

Download the directory and you're good to go.
Note that because this is a standalone app (a single page app). I decided to minify both CSS and JS code and include them inline.

## Edit

Because I'm using these files on http://syntaxhighlight.in, you'll need to edit:

   * humant.txt
   * Google Analytics script block
   * GitHub ribbon
